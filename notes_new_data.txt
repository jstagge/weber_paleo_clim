Significant change to Rockport storage  (RES2)
Median increase of 5,073

Small increase in East Canyon (Res5)
+ 25 (median


Res 1 has a mean increase of 830, but no change to median
Res 3 ""  of 327, ""
Res 4 "" of 2991, ""
Res 7 "" 643, ""
Res 8   2645, ""

Absolutely no effect on Res 6



Noticeable decrease of delivery to SA1 (median 1535, mean 1678)
Strangely, no real change in SA10 requests



No change to HW, WW
Base - 10 months move from triggers to non-trigger, 1 fewer extreme (1.39->1.11), 3 fewer severe, 6 fewer moderate
WD - 9 months move from triggers to non-trigger, 3 fewer extreme (8.89-8.06), 3 fewer severe, 3 fewer moderate
HW - 13 months move from triggers to non-trigger, 4 fewer extreme (13.33-12.22), 7 fewer severe, 2 fewer moderate






- that's about it









I'm looking at Q20 (in PaleoReconMonCorr-ReconPostProcAdj)
it lines up with Q20 Reach Gain Confluence.Inflow2 (in PaleoWeberOutput-Base)


He is using this weird adjustment factor (generally .9-1)



Q20 calculated from downstream (1949-1955) - two upstream (1988-present)

For paleo-
Calculated all of the inflows using Oakley gauge (10128500)
(mx + b) * adjustment  <- format
This went into Paleo run (and matches Paleo/Base output)

For clim change -
Weird - base of climate change seems to be exactly the observed calculated flows
Appears like PaleoReconMon-Observed is the actual observed, but also happens to be the "base" clim change scenario




Climate change should start in 1980 - unclear why the other dates are included.
